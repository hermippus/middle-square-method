# Middle square method
Middle-square is a method of generating pseudorandom numbers.

Simple implementation in C

** I take the resulting number and use it as a new seed, and everything is repeated to get the already prepared random number.

## Build with Makefile
```bash
# Build
$ make

# Clean
$ make clean
```
